The data for April 2021 – April 2022 was analyzed for this dashboard
Data Source: Citi Bike System Data | Citi Bike NYC
Key Findings:

1.	The traditional bikes continue to be the most used bikes followed by electric and docked bikes. The reason for less use of the docked bikes may be due to limited locations of docking stations available and people refraining from using public properties due to the pandemic during this period
2.	April – May of 2021 saw a rise in the use of docked bikes. However, the use of classic and electric grew thereafter, and we continue to see an upward growing trend for these two categories. In winter months, the bike program was used the least
3.	Overall, the use of bike is dropping. This may be as a result of the pandemic lockdowns being lifted which requires to travel farther distance for work, travel, shopping etc.
4.	Members/subscribers used the bike program over the casual users.
5.	The locations of the start and end stations (map) indicates that biker program is most popular in the most crowded areas (Manhattan and Jersey City).
Table of total rides from different end stations suggests that the most popular riding stations were to and from 14th Street Ferry,  Sinatra Drive, Bergen Ave, Ship Ave, South Waterfront walkway
